This is an event-based social networking app that connects users attending the same event.

Steps to open up app with a simulator:

1. On terminal, cd into main project folder
2. Type "npx expo start" and hit enter
3. Follow steps if expo is not installed, or if you have no simulator

- Refer to this link if no simulator: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-developer-tools/adding-additional-simulators

4. You can look at the UI either on your computer using the XCode Simulator, or through Expo Go app (scan QR code that shows up on terminal after Step 2)
